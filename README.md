Anime Feature Extraction

This project focuses on feature extraction from an anime dataset using Python. The notebook preprocesses and analyzes anime-related data to extract meaningful features that can be used for tasks such as recommendation systems, clustering, and predictive modeling.

Features

1.Data cleaning and preprocessing of anime dataset

2.Extraction of key features such as ratings, genres, popularity, and episodes

3.Transformation of raw attributes into structured, usable features

4.Foundation for building machine learning models in anime analytics (e.g., recommendation engines)

5.Exploratory visualizations to understand feature distributions

This project demonstrates how feature engineering plays a vital role in transforming raw datasets into actionable insights.
